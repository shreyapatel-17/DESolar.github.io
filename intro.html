            <p>The increased use of renewable and low-carbon energy has led to economic and environmental
                benefits. Among the renewable sources is the use of solar energy in for example on the rooftop
                of houses, buildings or on wide fields for power plants. Solar energy is commonly
                captured by photovoltaic panels. However, the efficiency of the panels is deteriorates in the presence
                of anomalies, such as hot spots. Hot spots occur due to non-uniform energy generation between
                the photo-voltaic cells, with differences that exceed 5% of the temperature admitted in standard test
                periods. These sudden temperature rises have the potential to lead to spontaneous ignition.
            </p>
            <p> Anomalies in solar panels lead to energy and temperature changes, so they are measured
                with current and voltage indicators and thermal sensors. The anomalies measured by
                thermal sensors are changes in energy efficiency, material fatigue and hot spots.
                However, hot spots can be catalogued at different levels of failure, which are associated with their
                geometry. Since the classification of anomalies with thermal cameras is based on their geometry,
                a first step for their correct classification is the identification of the solar panel. Related research has
                also focused on the detection of the solar panels array.
            </p>
            <p>Due to the creation of large solar plants, it has been required to incorporate the use of drones
                for the inspection of massive amounts of solar panels.

            <p>PV module defects are well studied and classified according to their nature, origin, and influence on the panel performance.
                 For a better understanding of the defect detection issue, let’s explore several most common types.
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Scratches on the glass</b>
                     break thin anti-reflective coating and potentially can lead to output degradation.</li>
                <li><b>Broken and chipped cells</b> 
                    may appear as edge breakages, pinholes, V-type breakages, and corner breakages. 
                    Defects of this type decrease the overall performance of the panel because its output is reduced to the lowest cell.</li>
                <li><b>Micro-cracks</b> 
                    are a serious problem. Undetected, they can significantly reduce panel lifespan. 
                    Visually they may appear in the form of the so-called snail trails 
                    (however, snail trails can also be caused by hotspots).</li>
                    <li><b>Interrupted contact fingers</b> 
                        (front contacts) reduce or even block the charge carriers flow,
                         diminishing the output of the whole panel.</li>
              </ul><br>
              <p>
                The defects listed above can be detected via manual inspection, however, it is a slow method requiring the use of expensive electrical detection circuitry. The increasing demand 
                for inspection speed (while maintaining a reasonable accuracy) calls for new tech-savvy approaches, such as industrial machine vision.

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
    <h1 class="display-4">Image-based solar panel inspection</h1><br>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>Since machine vision is one of the most common automated inspection methods in the semiconductor industry,
                 there is small wonder that it has been successfully applied to PV module defect detection during the manufacturing process. 
                 Additionally, the scientists from sunny Arizona have recently proved that the sky’s the limit for solar 
                panel inspection suggesting the use of image-based methods for regular inspection of PV modules at large solar farms.
            </p><br>
            <h4>In the production line</h4>
            <p>
                The software part of automated inspection of PV module usually consists of two steps:
                 image preprocessing and pattern recognition. In the first step, image filtering and edge 
                 enhancement methods are used to reduce the noise and enhance the defect visibility. 
                Then classification and clustering algorithms are employed to recognize the defective cells based on the features detected.
            </p>
            <p>
                To answer the demand for inspection accuracy, researchers continue experimenting with 
                classification and clustering techniques implicating supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods correspondingly.
